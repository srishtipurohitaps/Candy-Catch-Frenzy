# Candy Catch Frenzy

## What is Candy Catch Frenzy?

Candy Catch Frenzy is a simple, fast-paced game built in the Godot game engine using GDScript. You control a basket at the bottom of the screen and must catch as many falling candies as you can while dodging bombs. Some candies (like the rainbow one) refill your lives for a sweet comeback. Combo points reward skillful streaks.

## Why I Made This Project

I made Candy Catch Frenzy to practice my Godot skills, experiment with quick game prototyping, and to make something fun and playable in a short time. My main goal was to get better at implementing game feel, animations, movement, and rewarding feedback, while exploring the basics of making a project from start to finish.

## How I Made the Project

- **Engine:** Built entirely in Godot with GDScript for all the code
- **Sprites:** Simple self-made graphics (I used Canva)
- **Hierarchy:** Main scene for the game, independent scripts for candies, bombs, and the basket
- **Game mechanics implemented:**  
    - Spawning candies and bombs at random times and positions
    - Basket movement via the keyboard
    - Points and combos for catching candies
    - Rainbow powerup logic for life resets and visual effects
    - Feedback: screen shakes, scaling, color changes, fade-out instructions
- I tested and tweaked everything myself to try to keep things balanced and make the action feel satisfying.

## What I Struggled With & What I Learned

- **Godot UI/Anchors:** Centering and fading in-game instructions on all resolutions required experimenting with Godot’s layout system and manual code adjustments.
- **Polish:** Small touches, like screen shakes and pop-up labels, took lots of trial and error but make a big difference in “game feel.”
- **Difficulty/balance:** Making sure the action feels fair but challenging was hard without playtesters!
- **Iteration:** I learned how valuable it is to frequently playtest, even on small projects, and to break the codebase into reusable scripts/scenes.

## How to Play

- Move left/right with the arrow keys or A/D.
- Catch candies for points and combos.
- Avoid bombs or you’ll lose a life.
- Catch rainbow candies for a full life refill.

This project is a fun showcase of what you can build with Godot in a short time, and a nice milestone for my game design progress :)
